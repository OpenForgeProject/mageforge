# MageForge Advanced Usage

This document provides detailed information and advanced tips for using MageForge effectively in your Magento 2 development workflow.

## Theme Development Tips

### Command Efficiency

- Use shortcodes for faster command execution:
  - `m:t:b` instead of `mageforge:theme:build`
  - `m:t:w` instead of `mageforge:theme:watch`
  - `m:s:c` for system check

- Alternative aliases for common commands:
  - `frontend:build` for `mageforge:theme:build`
  - `frontend:watch` for `mageforge:theme:watch`

### Development Workflow

1. **System Check**: Before starting development, run a system check:
   ```bash
   bin/magento mageforge:system:check
   ```

2. **Enhanced Output**: Use the `-v` option for more detailed information during builds:
   ```bash
   bin/magento mageforge:theme:build <theme-code> -v
   ```

3. **Hot-reloading**: Watch mode automatically detects changes and rebuilds:
   - For LESS files in standard Magento themes
   - For Tailwind-based templates in Hyv채 themes
   - For custom CSS implementations

## Theme Type Specifics

### Standard Magento Themes (LESS)

For traditional LESS-based Magento themes, MageForge handles:
- LESS compilation
- Source map generation
- Minification for production

### Hyv채 Themes (Tailwind CSS)

MageForge streamlines Hyv채 theme development with:
- Automatic TailwindCSS compilation
- PurgeCSS optimization
- Component scanning

### Custom Tailwind CSS Implementations

For custom Tailwind setups (non-Hyv채), MageForge supports:
- Custom Tailwind configuration
- PostCSS processing
- Custom directory structures

### Avanta B2B Theme

MageForge has special support for Avanta B2B themes with:
- B2B-specific component scanning
- Special optimization for B2B module templates

## Performance Optimization

- Build specific theme components instead of entire themes for faster development
- Use the production flag for minified, optimized output when ready for deployment
- Consider selective watching for large themes to improve performance

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Build Failures**:
   - Ensure Node.js is installed and available
   - Check for syntax errors in LESS or CSS files
   - Verify Tailwind configuration is valid

2. **Watch Mode Issues**:
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure no conflicting processes are running

3. **Integration Problems**:
   - Clear Magento cache after theme builds
   - Verify theme registration in Magento
