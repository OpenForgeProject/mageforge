# MageForge Commands Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all commands available in the MageForge module. It's designed to help developers understand the structure and functionality of each command.

## Command Architecture

All commands in MageForge follow a consistent structure based on Symfony's Console Component. They extend the `Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command` class and implement:

- A constructor that injects dependencies
- A `configure()` method that sets the command name, description, and arguments/options
- An `execute()` method that handles the command logic

## Available Commands

### 1. ListThemeCommand (`mageforge:theme:list`)

**Purpose**: Lists all available Magento themes in the installation.

**File**: `/src/Console/Command/ListThemeCommand.php`

**Dependencies**:
- `ThemeList` - Service to retrieve theme information

**Usage**:
```bash
bin/magento mageforge:theme:list
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Retrieves all themes from the `ThemeList` service
- Displays a formatted table with theme information (code, title, path)
- Returns success status code

- Displays both versions for comparison

## Command Services

The commands rely on several services for their functionality:

### Builder Services
- `BuilderPool`: Manages theme builders and selects appropriate builders for themes
- `BuilderInterface`: Implemented by all theme builders
- `MagentoStandard\Builder`: Processes standard Magento LESS-based themes
- Various other builders for different theme types

### Theme Services
- `ThemeList`: Retrieves all installed themes
- `ThemePath`: Resolves theme codes to filesystem paths
- `StaticContentDeployer`: Handles static content deployment
- `CacheCleaner`: Manages cache cleaning after theme builds

### Utility Services
- `DependencyChecker`: Verifies required dependencies for theme building
- `GruntTaskRunner`: Executes Grunt tasks for theme compilation

## Command Execution Flow

1. The command is executed via the Magento CLI framework
2. Dependencies are injected via constructor
3. Arguments and options are processed
4. Interactive prompts are shown if required
5. The appropriate services are called to perform the command's task
6. Formatted output is displayed to the user
7. A status code is returned (success or failure)

## Error Handling

All commands implement error handling via try-catch blocks and return appropriate error messages and status codes when failures occur. Interactive commands also provide suggestions for resolving issues.
